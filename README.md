# Udacity-Computer-Vision-Nanodegree

### Program outline:

**This Nanodegree program is broken into three main sections:**

1- Intro to Computer Vision, which covers topics like image processing, feature extraction done manually or through training a convolutional neural network (CNN) using PyTorch.

2- Advanced Computer Vision and Deep Learning, which is all about advances in deep learning architectures like region-based CNN's, YOLO and single-shot detection algorithms, and CNN's used in combination with recurrent neural networks.

3- Object Tracking and Localization, which covers how a robot can move and sense the world around it, creating a visual representation of the world as it navigates.
